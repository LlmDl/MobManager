#######################################################################
SpawnMobs
#######################################################################
If true mobs will be allowed to spawn in this world.

Only present in world configs.

#######################################################################
Regions
#######################################################################
Used to define different regions each which have their own set of
    mobs which spawn within them.

Present in both the Global and World configs.

Currently there are four types of regions:
=> GlobalConfig only
- GLOBAL Represents every location
=> WorldConfig only
- POINT_CIRCLE Defines a region which covers a
    radius around a point
- POINT_SQUARE Defines a region which covers a
    X/Z distance from a point


Available region types are automatically generated into the config.

Regions:
  POINT_CIRCLE: {}
  POINT_SQUARE: {}

To create a custom region you can start off by simply setting the name
    of the region.

Regions:
  POINT_CIRCLE:
    TestRegion: {}
  POINT_SQUARE: {}

Reload MobManager and the required information will be generated
    into the config for you.

Regions:
  POINT_CIRCLE:
    TestRegion:
      Priority: 1
      SpawnAttempts: 1
      SpawnAttemptChance: 100.0
      MaxBlockRange: 56
      MinBlockRange: 24
      MinY: 0
      MaxY: 256
      X: 0
      Z: 0
      Radius: 0
      Mobs: []
  POINT_SQUARE: {}

  
After this is done, fill in the required information and reload MM


There are a set of region settings which are present in all
    region types.

Nodes: Priority, SpawnAttempts, SpawnAttemptChance, MinBlockRange and Mobs.

################
Priority
################
This represents the priority given to the region.

This is used when two regions overlap at a point.

When a region is fetched at a point where two overlap,
    the region with the higher value for priority has
    a higher chance of being picked.

################
SpawnAttempts
################
This is the number of spawn attempts to make for each player
    every time the spawner runs.

Spawn attempts can fail if mobs attempt to spawn in unsafe locations
     or if they attempt to spawn in locations with no regions
     or if the region selected contains no mobs which meet
     their requirements.

################
SpawnAttemptChance
################
This is a percent chance out of 100% in which a spawn attempt
    will be executed. If this chance fails the spawn attempt
    will not be executed.

You can make use of this to have more random numbers of spawn attempts
    per player.

################
MaxBlockRange
################
This is the maximum range in blocks which a mob is allowed
    to spawn afar from the player.

This will be forced lower if the limiters spawn range
    is lower

################
MinBlockRange
################
This is the minimum range in blocks which a mob is allowed
    to spawn nearby to a player.

Spawn locations are not generated between the player up
    till this distance.

This distance can cause spawn generation to fail if another
    player is within range of the generated spawn.
    
################
MaxUndergroundBlockRange
################
Replaces MaxBlockRange when the player is under the height
    set as UndergroundHeight.

################
MinUndergroundBlockRange
################
Replaces MinBlockRange when the player is under the height
    set as UndergroundHeight.

################
UndergroundHeight
################
When a player is under this height the spawner will use
   different min/max block ranges for spawning mobs.

################
MaxPlayerMobs
################
Defines the limit to how many mobs a player can have spawned around
    them before mobs are prevented from spawning.

The players limit is based on the number of mobs specifically
     spawned around them (Doesn't coun't for mobs spawned for
     other nearby players)

The limit is reset after teleporting between worlds or 100 blocks.
The limit is also reduced after the mob dies.

################
MaxPlayerMobGroups
################
Similar to MaxPlayerMobs but allows finer control on groups of mobs.
A mob can be put into one mob player group which allows a
    separate limit for players for mobs in that given group.

For regions without a given group, the region will be assumed
    to have no limits for that group.

e.g.

MaxPlayerMobGroups:
  GroupOneLimit: 5
  GroupTwoLimit: 10

################
PlayerMobCooldown
################
The time in seconds after a mob is removed from a players max mobs limit

################
MaxRegionMobs
################
Defines the maximum number of mobs which can be alive which
    were spawned by this region

################
RegionMobCooldown
################
Defines how long in seconds before a mob which is counted towards
    this regions 'MaxRegionMobs' is removed from the limit

################
EnforceAllCooldownConditions
################
If true, a mob will not be removed from the max alive
    limit unless it is both dead and the cooldown has passed  

################
Mobs
################
Every region has a list of mobs which spawn within the region along
    with a set of requirements which must be met for the mob to spawn.

Mobs:
- SpawnChance: 1
  MaxAlive: 0
  MobCooldown: 60
  EnforceAllCooldownConditions: false
  HeightOffset: 0
  BypassMobManagerLimit: false
  BypassPlayerAndRegionMobLimit: false
  DelayRequirementsCheck: false
  MobType: ZOMBIE
  AbilitySet: none
  Requirements:
    MinLight: 0
    MaxLight: 15
    MinY: 0
    MaxY: 256
    MinTime: 0
    MaxTime: 24000
    SlimeLikeSpawnSeed: 0
    RequireOpaqueBlock: true
    BlockList: []
    BlockWhitelist: false
    BiomeList: []
    EnvironmentList: []
    BiomeWhitelist: false
  Action:
    MessageSettings:
      FinderMode: CYLINDER
      Radius: 0
      Height: 0
    RandomMessage: false
    Messages: []
    CommandSettings:
      FinderMode: CYLINDER
      Radius: 0
      Height: 0
    Commands: []


Nodes:
- SpawnChance =>
    The chance of the mob to spawn relative to other
    mobs which met the requirements of the spawn

- MaxAlive =>
    The maximum number of this mob which can be alive
    at any one time.

- MobCooldown =>
    The time in seconds after which a mob is not counted
    towards the max alive limit

- EnforceAllCooldownConditions =>
    If true, a mob will not be removed from the max alive
    limit unless it is both dead and the cooldown has passed  

- HeightOffset =>
    The height in blocks which this mob will be spawned above
    normal. Could be helpful with flying mobs which spawn far above
    normal mobs.

- BypassMobManagerLimit =>
    If true this mob will bypass the check to see if the Limiter
    component will allow it to spawn.

- BypassPlayerAndRegionMobLimit =>
    If true this mob will not count towards the players or
    regions mob limit.
    This could be useful with boss mobs which you still want to spawn
    even if there are many other mobs around such as bosses.
    When enabling this, you should have MaxAlive set or a very low chance
    to ensure spawning of this mob does not get out of hand.

- DelayRequirementsCheck =>
    Mob spawn chances are based on the mobs which can spawn in the
    random location chosen, if this is true, it is assumed the
    mob can spawn, and this is checked afterwards when the mob
    has been chosen. If requirements fail at this point no
    mob is spawned. Can be useful if you want to make it
    clearer on the chances of spawning given mobs.

- MobType =>
    The type of mob which this 'Mob' will spawn

- AbilitySet =>
    The name of the ability set you wish to apply
    to the mob (Must have the AbilityComponent enabled)

    Note: MobType is not required if the AbilitySet
    has a default MobType assigned.

- Requirements =>
    Requirements which the spawn location has to satisfy
    else the mob will not get a chance to spawn.
    
    Requirement Nodes:
    - SlimeLikeSpawnSeed: The seed to use to determine
        which chunks this mob can spawn in. Set to 0
        to disable.
    - MinLight: The minimum amount of light at the spawn
    - MaxLight: The maximum amount of light at the spawn
    - MinY: The minimum Y location of the spawn
    - MaxY: The maximum Y location of the spawn
    - MinTime: The minimum world time the mob can spawn (0-24000)
    - MaxTime: The maximum world time the mob can spawn (0-24000)
    - SlimeLikeSpawnSeed: Only lets the mob spawn in certain
        chunks dependant on the seed given. 1/10 chunks will
        be spawnable. Works exactly the same as vanilla
        Slime spawning. Seed must be a number.
        If seed is 0 it is disabled.
    - RequireOpaqueBlock: Requires that the block the mob
        spawns on is solid. (i.e. not water/lava)
    - <Type>List: List of <Type> which the spawn
        (must|must not) have at least one of.
    - <Type>Whitelist: If true the <Type> at the spawn
        must be within the <Type>List
        Else it must not be within the <Type>List
    
    Types:
    - Block: Use block names from this link
        http://jd.bukkit.org/dev/apidocs/org/bukkit/Material.html
    - Biome: Use biome names from this link
        http://jd.bukkit.org/dev/apidocs/org/bukkit/block/Biome.html
    - Environment: Use environments names from this link
        http://jd.bukkit.org/dev/apidocs/org/bukkit/World.Environment.html

- Action =>
    Defines an action to perform upon the spawn of the mob.
    
    Action Nodes:
    - RandomMessage: If true, a single message is chosen from the list
        and sent to nearby players. Else all messages are sent to
        nearby players in order
    - Messages: A list of messages to send to nearby players.
        Can contain '{player}' which is replaced with the players name.
        Can also contain & colour codes.
    - Commands: A list of commands to run.
        Can contain '{player}'. If this is done the command is run
        once for every player within range. Else it is executed once.
    - <Action>Settings:
        -> FinderMode: CYLINDER or SPHERE. CYLINDER is slightly
            more efficient.
        -> Radius: Used for the radius of the sphere or
            circle (If CYLINDER is used)
        -> Height: Only used for CYLINDER. Determines the
            height of the cylinder search for players.
