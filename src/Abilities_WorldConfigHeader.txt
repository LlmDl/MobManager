If this is false then settings 'EnabledSpawnReasons' and 'MobAbilities'
will have no effect, and the global configuration for mobs will be used

NOTE: This setting does nothing in the global config

#######################################################################
EnabledSpawnReasons
#######################################################################
When a Mob spawns, it is spawned with a given 'SpawnReason'
    This list defines which of those 'SpawnReasons' that MobManager
	will check for.
If a mob spawns with a listed 'SpawnReason' MobManager will apply
    abilities to the mob
	
Hint: If you have other plugins which spawn mobs with special gear
    you can remove CUSTOM from the list of enabled spawn reasons
	so MobManager does not interfere with this

Note: By default all spawn reasons are checked

Valid spawn reasons can be found here:
    http://jd.bukkit.org/apidocs/org/bukkit/event/entity/CreatureSpawnEvent.SpawnReason.html

#######################################################################
MobAbilities
#######################################################################
Contains settings you can use to edit mob attributes.

Mob settings in world files will override global settings

Mob names must be acquired from here:
    http://jd.bukkit.org/apidocs/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
    And should be in all upper-case

There are currently two types of mob Attributes/Abilities:
1) Rate: These have a single fixed chance of doing something

    rates are written as a simple number between 1.0 and 0.0

2) ChanceList: These are a list of chances with values associated
    with each chance. The chance of a given value being selected is
    (chance) / (Sum of all chances)
    
    Each ChanceList has keys which can be used to customize the abilities
    These keys can have numbers, strings or lists as their values.
    
    NOTE: Every Ability requires the key 'Chance'
    
    ChanceLists are written as below
    <OPTION>:
    - CHANCE: <Chance>
      <KEY>: <Options>
